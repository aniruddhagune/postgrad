## Problem Statement

Implement FCFS, SJF and SJF (pre-emptive) on processes in C/C++.
User input: number of processes, CPU bursts and arrival times.
Use different algorithms on the same data, and calculate Waiting time, Turnaround time and Response Time for the processes. Calculate averages of these values.
Compare the average metrics between different algorithms.

## SJF

Sorts and serves processes in the order of their required CPU burst time.
Processes are completed and there is no preemption involved.
