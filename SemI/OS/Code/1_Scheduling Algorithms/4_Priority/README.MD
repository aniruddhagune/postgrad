## Problem Statement

Implement FCFS, SJF and SJF (pre-emptive) on processes in C/C++.
User input: number of processes, CPU bursts and arrival times.
Use different algorithms on the same data, and calculate Waiting time, Turnaround time and Response Time for the processes. Calculate averages of these values.
Compare the average metrics between different algorithms.

## Priority

Sorts and serves processes based on their priority number.
