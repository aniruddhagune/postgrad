// Pretty much like arrays, also use contiguous memory locations.

// Main difference is the overhead they have when they need to actually grow in size,
// which is when they'll copy the entire array into another (bigger) contiguous memory location and
// then delete the existing array.

// Size when growing is generally 1.5x or 2x the current size.
// The resizing process is also O(n) due to the copying operation,
// but itâ€™s generally less frequent because vectors use a strategy to grow their capacity in larger increments
// to reduce the number of resizes.

// Another notable overhead is insertion at the beginning or middle,
// because elements may be shifted.
// This operation takes linear time, `O(n)`. It's `O(1)` for inserting at the end.

// They do automatically manage memory, in comparison to arrays where it's manual. Dynamic and static nature.
